## Java National Pokedex


This repository contains a Pokemans.java file that can print out all the Pokemon from the first nine generations of Pokemon. It consists of different new Java skills that were learned within CS143.

## Description

The Pokemans.java file has a complete list of all the released Pokemon as of the 13th of March. It contains all 1025 Pokémon and all the basic information provided in any other pokedex with an easy to search function by using their names. The program boots up by asking you what Pokémon you are searching for with console input. You could either search for the Pokémon you want from the string of its name or by inputting the number you are looking for. There is also a game within the program that allows it to guess the Pokémon you are thinking of. While the game isn't guaranteed to narrow down the specific Pokémon due to its wide search parameter, it will narrow it down the best it can, giving the info you provide. Also within the game, you can see all the Pokémon that meet the parameters of the questions you answered. To see what is currently still being narrowed down, type meetsreq. To enter the game mode of the pokedex type game when prompted to enter a pokemon.


The Pokedata folder consists of all the text files needed for this program to run. It has all of the Pokémon data separated by typing, height, evolution status, weight, color, generation number, and whether or not it has a hidden ability.

The Testcases folder is a series of text files that can be used to simulate keyboard input and check a variety of different cases, such as printing out Pokémon from the dex and getting to the bottom questions within the game.
